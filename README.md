# About

Go Eat Co. is an application for creating weekly meal plans, storing recipes and keeping track of ingredients. It's designed and built to make meal planning easy for busy households.

# UX

## Strategy

### The problem

For busy households, there's very little time to create healthy mealplans for the family. This leads to expensive and less healthy alternatives (takeout), wasted food, extra packaging and sometimes frustrating mealtimes too!

### The solution

Go Eat Co. (fictional client, aka me) has had an app designed and developed that makes meal planning easy. By using a shared library of recipes and ingredients, it's quick to put together a meal plan that fits dietary needs, and will even generate the shopping list. This helps to reduce waste, save time, and make meal planning a joy.

### Target audience
Anyone juggling multiple responsibilities but also looking to take care of their health by eating well. Especially great for busy parents who are tired of coming up with healthy solutions for fussy children.

### Personas
Chris, 38, single, parent to 2 children (aged 9 and 10), works for the NHS, vegetarian.
Introverted and active, cares about health and fitness for himself and his children. Tends to work too much. Loves the outdoors and to hike or cycle everywhere.

Sophie, 36, married, parent to 4 children (aged from 2 to 9) and a labrador.
Social and semi-active, very short on time with a full calendar of family events. Loves organising parties and sleepovers. Always puts her family first. Enjoys walking and cares about the environment and her family's impact.

### User goals
- Be more organised in the kitchen.
- Reduce kitchen waste, including food and packaging.
- Eat healthily.
- Save money.

### Business objectives
- Create an MVP that allows for easy meal planning to build trust and awareness of the brand.
- Build a community of users that will help beta test future releases and potentially pay for premium features.
- (subgoal) Provide education on reducing waste and saving money through meal planning to create traffic to the site.
